# Web-Design-Challenge
This repository is for the Web-Design-Challenge homework assignment. For this assignment, a website was built to present data from a previous assignment where the relationship between latitude and various weather patterns was observed. The weather patterns included max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

The website has a landing (or home) page that provides an overview of the study. From here, the user can go to each of the four visualizations which includes a summary of findings for the relationship. Also, the user can navigate to a "Comparison" page that allows the user to compare all visualizations at one time. Finally, there is also a page which includes all of the underlying data used furing this study.

A navigation bar allows the user to easily navigate through the website regardless of what page they are on. Bootstrap was used to allow ease-of-access to users on computers or mobile devices.
